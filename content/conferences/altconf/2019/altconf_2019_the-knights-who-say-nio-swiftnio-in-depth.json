  "description" : "SwiftNIO is an exciting new event-driven network application library from Apple written in Swift. Based on the architecture pioneered by Netty, it provides a foundation for highly scalable cloud services that can be built quickly and easily. In this session I will explore how SwiftNIO can be used to create high performance network services and how I was able to use it to create my own MQTT server (a lightweight messaging service). Finally, Iâ€™ll compare and contrast the performance of my simple implementation to enterprise grade solutions to see how Swift and SwiftNIO stack up in performance critical environments."
