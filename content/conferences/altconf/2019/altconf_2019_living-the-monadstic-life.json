  "description" : "You may think that Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads are scary. In this keynote, Daniel will show you that “you are already soaking in it”. These patterns are in the life you’re already living - now we just need to get it into your code. Though familiarity with Calculus and Hate Driven Development might aid in your enjoyment of the session, neither is required."
