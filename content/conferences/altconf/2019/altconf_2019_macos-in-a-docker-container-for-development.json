  "description" : "MacStadiumâ€™s development team wanted to take advantage of the capability and power of Docker\/Kubernetes in a Mac development environment, but there was no good solution. To solve this problem, the team decided to build a tool to put macOS in a Docker container. In this session, Chris will talk about how he and his team used Docker to solve their Mac build problems."
