  "description" : "The last few years has seen a growth in popularity of larger sized phones. Hands have not evolved to match this increase in size, as a result it can be be difficult for users to use a phone easily, especially if circumstances call for the phone to be used one-handed. This was the situation I faced in developing my latest software. In this presentation we will look at some simple layout techniques that can be used to make an application easier for a person to use. We will also consider the different needs of left-handed and right-handed users."
