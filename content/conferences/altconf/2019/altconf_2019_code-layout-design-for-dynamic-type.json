  "description" : "Apple has made great improvements to the ease of supporting Dynamic Type in our apps, but has remained fairly quiet on guidance around handling the flexible layouts and design issues that result. This talk will cover the implementation fundamentals, autolayout tips, and design considerations that will enable your apps to be enjoyed by users across a wider spectrum of visual acuity."
