  "description" : "Sometimes, we know what we want. Other times, we don‘t. We make thousands of decisions every day. Some questions we ask ourselves: what is the next step in my career? Will I always be a developer? Did I reach the ceiling as a developer? Am I confused by trying to figure out what‘s next for me? If those questions have never crossed your mind, join the talk to hear my story. If they did – join my talk to, maybe, create your own new story."
