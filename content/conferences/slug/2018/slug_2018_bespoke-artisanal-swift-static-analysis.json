  "description" : "Have you ever fixed a bug in your code and wondered if you made that mistake elsewhere? Wouldn't it be great if you could teach the Swift compiler to catch that bug next time you wrote it? In this talk, we'll learn how you can build custom static analysis tools for Swift to make sure you never write the same bug twice."
