  "description" : "What is the simplest hash implementation? How about the worst? What is a hash anyway? And why does it matter? By the end of this talk, you'll have the answers to these questions. Youâ€™ll also be able to whiteboard out a solution at your next on site interview, no longer be frightened of hash collisions, and understand the hashable changes coming up in Swift 4.2."
