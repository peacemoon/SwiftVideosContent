  "description" : "Most of PlanGridâ€™s codebase in Swift, but they have a legacy Obj-C network sync layer. To manage getting JSON data that has already been decoded in Obj-C into their Swift models, they wrote JSONObjectDecoder. Ben will talk about the constraints that drove PlanGrid to this decision, building a Decoder from scratch, and some of the enhancements you can make once you have a working custom Decoder."
