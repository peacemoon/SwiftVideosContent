  "description" : "Over the last few months, I've been working on a project around better CoreImage filter documentation (https:\/\/cifilter.io). Using that as a framework, we'll go through an overview of CIImage and CIFilter, how to use them in Swift, how we use CIFilter at PlanGrid, some tricky CoreImage gotchas. There will even be a demo or two about applying CIFilters and how to write your own filter using GLSL."
