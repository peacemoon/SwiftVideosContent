  "description" : "With the release of Swift 5.1, and the introduction of SwiftUI, we saw a new type of attribute added to the language, known as Property Wrappers. These ‘@‘-prefixed attributes open up a treasure chest of new type functionalities, and can be used to simplify some existing behaviors. In this talk I will go over what property wrappers are and where to use them, as well as how to create your own. It is aimed at anybody who is building apps with Swift 5.1."
