  "description" : "The N Body Problem is a computationally complex problem that we use to predict how planets and galaxies – and everything in between – move through space. I’ll show you some interesting ways to calculate it, and we’ll have a look at what to do, should you find yourself in a space ship’s pilot seat. When you leave this talk, you should have at least a general idea of analysis of complex algorithms as well as orbital mechanics."
