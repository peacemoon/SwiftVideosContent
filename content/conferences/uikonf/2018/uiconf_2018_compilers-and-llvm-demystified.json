  "description" : "Have compilers just seemed like a big black box for you? Have you ever wondered what happens on your codeâ€™s journey from the time you write it to when it gets executed? In this talk we want to take a close look at the LLVM compiler infrastructure used in the Swift compiler and also in many other languages. We will use a swift wrapper around LLVM called LLVMSwift to implement a toy compiler in Swift for an example language."
