  "description" : "In this talk, John will show how UI testing can not only be a powerful tool in order to automate parts of your QA process - but how it can also be a somewhat “magical” tool when it comes to working on your app as well. The talk will include pros & cons of UI testing, how to make tests run faster & more stable, and how UI tests can be used during the development process."
